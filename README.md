## Features of SUL

- Easy to learn. You can start talking in SUL in under an hour.
- No synonyms in the 'core' SUL dictionary. For example there is only 1 word that means 'good' instead of multiple words like 'good' and 'well'.
- No homonyms in the 'core' SUL dictionary. For example no misunderstandings caused by not knowing if someone means walking 'past' the car or something that happened in the 'past'.
- No two words are spelled or pronounced the same way.
- Very little punctuation.
- Properly supports references to people with non-binary genders.
- Virtually no grammar or syntax exceptions in the entire language.
- Excellent accessability for people visually or audibly handicapped. The standard SUL letters are easy to see from a distance because the characters are mono spaced and visually unique. For the hearing impaired, all SUL characters can easily be transcribed into braille. SUL letters also easily and naturally collapse into symbols when visual space is at a premium (text messaging etc).
- SUL is a phonetic language. This means that the pronunciation of a word is very similar to the spelling of the word. This makes it easy to learn how to pronounce words.
- Pronounciation of SUL letters and words never changes, even depending on letter position.
- Extended dictionary of more than 80 thousand words is available for transcribing the meaning of artforms like poetry.
- SUL is versioned and refactored similar to programming languages. The language continues to improve and become even more useful over time.
- Vagueness in the SUL language is impossible. There are no words like 'it' or 'that'.
- It's extremely easy to automatically transcribe SUL into other languages while being certain that meaning of the words has not been altered. You could write subtitles for a movie once and have the meaning transcribed to every other language with high accuracy.
- Excellent for machine learning purposes due to the simplicity of the language and consistency of it's rules.
- You only need to learn a fraction of the words as compared to other langauges.
- SUL is almost completely deterministic. When you hear or read SUL the meaning can virtually not be mistaken.
- SUL words only ever mean exactly one thing. No SUL word is a both a noun and an adjective, etc.
